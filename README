1. Use "make" to compile and use "make clean" to clean up all the compiled files. The executable file is named as "RACIPE" by default.

2. Run the package:
  1> Run with the .topo file:
    $ ./RACIPE *.topo [options]
    RACIPE generates two files according to the topology information (in the .topo file):
    - Configuration file (.cfg file) storing all the settings for the simulation (the .cfg file can be used in the second method to run the package, see below);
    - Parameter file (.prs file) storing ranges of the parameters for randomization.

    If the "-flag" option is set to 0 (default), RACIPE will calculate the results for all RACIPE models and generate "_parameter.dat", "_solution_.dat", and "_T_test.dat".
    If the "-flag" option is set to 1, only the .cfg and .prs will be generated.

    Example:
    $make
    $./RACIPE TS.topo [options]

  2> Run with the .cfg file
    $ ./RACIPE *.cfg [options]
    .prs file will be automatically generated/updated according to the settings in .cfg file no matter the old .prs file exists or not.
    
    To change the settings of the simulation, users can either change the .cfg file directly or use options. However, the options that are set in the command line will always override the settings in the .cfg file. New configuration file will be generated as "_tmp.cfg" in the same folder to store the simulation settings for the current run.

    Similarily,
    If the "-flag" option is set to 0 (default), RACIPE will calculate the results for all RACIPE models and generate "_parameter.dat", "_solution_.dat", and "_T_test.dat".
    If the "-flag" option is set to 1, the updated configuration file will be generated as "_tmp.cfg" in the same folder.

3. Options
Use "./RACIPE -h" to find all available options.

-h             : Show all available options.
-maxtime       : Maximum time for the simulation (Default 23.5 h).
-solver        : The integrator method (1 --> Euler or 2 --> RK45) to solve the ODEs equations (Default 1).
-flag          : run RACIPE to produce the .cfg file only or the whole simulation (Default 0, perform the whole simulation).

-KDID          : Gene or link (See their ID in the .cfg file) to be knocked down. 
-OEID          : Gene (See their ID in the .cfg file) to be overexpressed. (follow by -OEFD).
-OEFD          : Fold change to overexpress a gene (-OEID must be first set in the option, the value need to be bigger than 1). (Default 1) if the corresponding OEFD is not set, it will be set to 1.
-DEID          : Gene (See their ID in the .cfg file) to be downexpressed. (follow by -DEFD).
-DEFD          : Fold change to downexpress a gene (-DEID must be first set in the option, the value need to be bigger than 1). (Default 1) if the corresponding DEFD is not set, it will be set to 1.
               Attention: The .prs file will be same as the one without Knockdown/downexpression/overexpression treatments. Multiple genes or links can be treated at the same time by putting multiple -KDID, -OEID, -DEID in the command line or modifying the .cfg file. 

-dist          : Distribution used for randomization:
                 1 ---> Uniform Distribution (Default);
                 2 ---> Gaussian Distribution;
                 3 ---> Exponential Distribution.
-SF            : Scale the distribution ranges of all the parameters except for the hill coefficients, should be smaller than 1 (Default 1).
-num_findT     : The number of simulations used to estimate the thresholds (Default 10000).
-num_paras     : The number of RACIPE models to generate (Default 100).
-num_ode       : The number of Random initial values to solve ODEs (Default 100).
-num_stability : The maximum number of stable states to save for one RACIPE model (Default 10).
-thrd          : Cutoff for convergence of steady states for numerically solving ODEs (Default 1.0).
-Toggle_f_p    : Save parameters of each RACIPE model or not (Default 1 (yes)).
-stepsize      : Stepsize for solving ODEs (Default 0.1).
-maxiters      : The maximum number of iterations for solving ODEs at each random initial condition times 1000 (Default 20).
-Toggle_T_test : Test the threshold assumption or not (Default 1 (yes)).
-SBML_model    : Output a model in the SBML format. The parameter will be the ID of the model (start from 1) to save (Default 0 (no SBML output)).
-seed          : random seed (Default 1). 
                 Attention: the actual seed used by the package is a function of the starting time and the seed set here. -seed is used for the case you run the package at the same time for the same circuit several times. 

-minP          : Minimum production  rate (Default 1.0).
-maxP          : Maximum production  rate (Default 100.0).
-minK          : Minimum degradation rate (Default 0.1).
-maxK          : Maximum degradation rate (Default 1.0).
-minN          : Minimum Hill coefficient (Default 1.0).
-maxN          : Maximum Hill coefficient (Default 6.0).
-minF          : Minimum fold change (Default 1.0).
-maxF          : Maximum fold change (Default 100.0).

4. Input files
  1> Topology file (.topo file)
     Format of the topology file, such as TS.topo:
     Source  Target  Type
     A       B       1
     ...     ...     ...

     Types of regualtions: 1 --> Activation; 2 --> Inhibition;

  Or

  2> Configure file (.cfg file), generated by the package. See details below.

5. Output files
  1> Standard output on screen, which can be redirected to the other file.
     It contains the topology information, the result of testing the half-functional rule for each gene, the information of system stability, and running time.

  2> configure file (.cfg file).
     It generated by the package, contains the settings for the simulation, the ID for each gene (two columns: ID, Gene name) and regulatory links (four columns: ID, Gene ID, Gene ID, Type of regulation (consistent with the topology file)) 

     Attention:
     1. When directly modifying the .cfg file to use different random distributions, users should change the number after 'Distribution', and replace the name of the distribution after the number (optional).
     2. When directly modifying the .cfg file for knockdown genes or links, users should change the 'number_of_KDs' to be the total number of genes and links to be knocked down, and put the Genes' ID and Links' ID after 'KD_ID' separated by space or tab.
     3. When directly modifying the .cfg file for over/down expression of a gene, users should change the 'number_of_OEs' and/or 'number_of_DEs' to the genes to be treated, and put the gene IDs after 'OE_ID' and/or 'DE_ID'; users also need to set up the fold changes after 'OE_Fold_Change' and/or 'DE_Fold_Change'.

  3> Parameter file (.prs file). 
     It is generated by the package, and it contains ranges of the parameters for randomization. It would be updated when users run with the .cfg file.

  4> Temporary configure file (_tmp.cfg), generated when the package runs with the .cfg file; it contains the updated settings for the simulation.
  
  5> _parameter.dat which contains the parameters of each RACIPE model.
     Format of _parameter.dat:
     Model_index Number_of_stable_states Parameters_of_model

     number_of_stable_states            : The number of stable steady states of the RACIPE model.
     Parameters_of_model                : The meaning of each column is in the same order as the parameters in the .prs file.

  6> _solution_.dat which contains the gene expression for each stable steady state in log2 scale.
     The models with different number of stable states are stored in different files, e.g. monostable models are stored in _solution_1.dat, and bistable models are stored in _solution_2.dat.
     Format of _solution_.dat:
     Model_index Number_of_stable_states Solutions

     Solutions               : The meaning of each column is consistent with the order of gene IDs in the .cfg file.

  7> _T_test.dat storing the test of the half functional rule for each RACIPE model.
     Format of _T_test.dat:
     Model_index Over_threshold_A Below_threshold_A ... 

     Over_threshold_A  : The number of stable states for the current RACIPE model whose expression of gene A is larger than its threshold parameter of A.
     Below_threshold_A : The number of stable states for the current RACIPE model whose expression of gene A is smaller than its threshold parameter of A.

     For each model, the probability for gene A's expression to be larger than its threshold equals to the sum of Over_threshold_A across all the models divided by the sum of both Over_threshold_A and Below_threshold_A across all the models.
